len(w for w in text) is not a thing. len works for defined objects, not iterables. 
Instead, use sum(1 for w in text)

Use memoize!!! huuge difference

 
If your program uses a lot of files, you want Python to close them after use. Here's how:
>>> with open("lexicon.txt") as f:
...     data = f.read()

Python will automatically close file after use.
