nltk.Index((key as a function of w, value as a function of w) for w in text) 


nltk.Index is a defaultdict(list) with extra support for initialization. Similarly, nltk.FreqDist is essentially a defaultdict(int) with extra support for initialization (along with sorting and plotting methods).


eg:
---

>>> anagrams = defaultdict(list)
>>> for word in words:
...     key = ''.join(sorted(word))
...     anagrams[key].append(word)
...

Is equivalent to 

anagrams = nltk.Index((''.join(sorted(word)), word) for word in words)
