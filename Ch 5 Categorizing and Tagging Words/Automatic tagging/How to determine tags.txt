1: Morphological Clues:

egs:

happy --> happiness (ness turns verbs into nouns)
ing --> turns verb to present participle | turns verb to noun (this is called a gerund)

2: Syntactic Clues
'to' is often followed by verbs. If not, nouns.
adjectives often occur before nouns or follow words like 'be' and 'very'

3: Semantic Clues
i.e. meaning of words. current theory is to treat this approach with suspicion--it doesn't seem to automate well.

4: New Words
new words tend to be nouns. Nouns are known as an open class for that reason. By contrast, prepositions are a closed
class and are stable over time.

5: Morphology in Part of Speech Tagsets
what we've been studying this chapter. We have to use more refined tags than just verb, for example. We use stuff
like VBZ VBN VBG etc in Brown. Different tagsets will have varying levels of refinement and there is a tradeoff 
between generality and specificity.
