Both ngram tagging and Brill tagging are supervised training methods. Meaning the correct tag is provided.

Brill tagging works by guessing the tag of each word, then going back and fixing mistakes. Instead of counting
observations, it stores information about a list of transformations correction rules.



Eg: 
---

sent: The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation

*We will examine the operation of two rules: (a) Replace NN with VB when the previous word is TO; (b) Replace TO with IN when the next tag is NNS. 6.1 illustrates this process, first tagging with the unigram tagger, then applying the rules to fix the errors.

Phrase	to	increase	grants	to	states	for	vocational	rehabilitation
Unigram	TO	NN	NNS	TO	NNS	IN	JJ	NN
Rule 1	 	VB	 	 	 	 	 	 
Rule 2	 	 	 	IN	 	 	 	 
Output	TO	VB	NNS	IN	NNS	IN	JJ	NN
Gold	TO	VB	NNS	IN	NNS	IN	JJ	NN
