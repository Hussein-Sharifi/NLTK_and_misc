Before we hit the DefaultTagger/RegexpTagger layer, we can try tagging unknown words the following way:

We keep the n most frequent words in the training set, and replace every other word with UNK. Then if we have 
the context '... to UNK', our Ngram tagger will have seen many instances of this pattern, usually with the result
that UNK is tagged as a verb.
