nltk.UnigramTagger(gold tagged sents).tag(word_tokens)

Explanation

this trains the unigram tagger using a tagged dataset, hopefully a gold standard one. Again, this tagger works
by assigning each word its most likely tag using some statistically generated dictionary model. 

eg:
---

gold = brown.tagged_sents(categories = 'news')
unigram_tagger = nltk.UnigramTagger(gold)
unigram_tagger.tag(word tokens)
