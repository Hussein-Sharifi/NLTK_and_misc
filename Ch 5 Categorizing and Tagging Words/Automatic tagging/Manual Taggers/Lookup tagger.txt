nltk.UnigramTagger(model = dict model, backoff = alternative tagger)

Explanation:

The idea here is to create a tagger that assigns the n most frequent words in a text with their most likely tag.
We do this by creating a dictionary model where each nth word is a key and its value is the most likely tag. We
achieve this using FreqDist and ConditionalFreqDist. When the unigram tagger encounters a word not in the most
frequent list, it will defer to the alternative tagger.

eg:
---

words = brown.words(categories = 'news')
tagged_words = brown.tagged_words(categories = 'news')

fd = nltk.FreqDist(words)
cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(tagged_words)

most_freq_words = fd.most_common(100)
most_freq_tags = dict((w, cfd[w].max()) for (w,_) in most_freq_words)

baseline_tagger = nltk.UnigramTagger(model = most_freq_tags,
					backoff = nltk.DefaultTagger('NN'))

baseline_tagger.tag(word tokens)
baseline_tagger.evaluate(control tagged sents)
