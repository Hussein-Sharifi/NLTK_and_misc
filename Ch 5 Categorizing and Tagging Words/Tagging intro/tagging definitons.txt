Part-of-speech tagging: classifying words into parts of speech into word classes (AKA lexical categories)

*Articles is same class as determiners (a, the)
*modals (should, may)
*personal pronouns (she, they)

tagset: collection of tags used for a text

CC: coordinating conjunction (such as 'and')
RB: adverb
IN: preposition
NN: noun
NP: noun proper
JJ: adjective
PRP: pronoun, personal
VB: verb, base form
VBP: verb, present tense, not 3rd person singular
VBN: verb, present participle
TO: to
DT: determiner (such as 'the')

Unsimplified tags: contain info such as $ for possessive (NN$ is possessive pronoun), S for plural, P for proper, -NC for citations, -HL for headlines, -TL for titles.


*NLTK provides documentation for each tag, which can be queried using the tag, e.g. nltk.help.upenn_tagset('RB'), or a regular expression, e.g. nltk.help.upenn_tagset('NN.*'). Some corpora have README files with tagset documentation, see nltk.corpus.???.readme(), substituting in the name of the corpus.
