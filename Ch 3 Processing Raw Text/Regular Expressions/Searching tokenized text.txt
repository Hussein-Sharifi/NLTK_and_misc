text.findall(reg_exp)

This is unique to using findall method with nltk:  <> brackets are used to distinguish tokens. It won't work without that. White space between them is ignored.

>>>moby.findall(r"<a> (<.*>) <man>")

mature; white; Cape; great; wise; wise; butterless; white; fiendish;
pale; furious; better; certain; complete; dismasted; younger; brave;

*You can only have one set of parentheses, otherwise it's a tuple and tuples are not supported.
*No parentheses means retrieve whole phrase
*Each <> is a word token.
