int, float, str, list: example of list I = ["apple", "banana"]. You can create a list using a logical expression: squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
                                                                                                             or consider    [(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]
f string: f"a string goes in here" 											  = [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]

dict: d = {'jack': 4098, 'sjoerd': 4127}. d['jack'] gives 4098.
has form {key: object}, where key must be immutable and object can be any type
more on dicts https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html

tuple: eg:  t = (1, 3, 'door'). 
(a, b, c) = t assigns each variable to the positionally respective component

set: {object1, object2, ...}
set('word') = {'w', 'o', 'r', 'd'}
a = {x for x in 'abracadabra' if x not in 'abc'} gives a = {'r', 'd'}

f string: f'blah blah {var1} said {var2}'

for, if, while loops
conditions can be combined with and, or, or for example a<b==d
can use in, not in, is, is not as conditions

elif (must be same indentation as parent if-statement)



try:
	___
except:
	___
finally:
	___

                                      these guys are optional but have unique properties and can be useful. Check 4.82 https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html

methods: example: list_name.append(): the .append is called a method of a list. It is a built-in function defined for a particular type, in this case a list.

_________________________________________________________________________
example for defining a class of objects with methods and match statement

class Point:
    __match_args__ = ('x', 'y')
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

c = Point(0,5)


def where_is(point):
	match points:
    	case []:
        	print("No points")
    	case [Point(0, 0)]:
        	print("The origin")
    	case [Point(x, y)]:
        	print(f"Single point {x}, {y}")
    	case [Point(0, y1), Point(0, y2)]:
        	print(f"Two on the Y axis at {y1}, {y2}")
    	case _:
        	print("Something else")


			you can also include if statement:

	match point:
    	case Point(x, y) if x == y:
        	print(f"Y=X at {x}")
    	case Point(x, y):
        	print(f"Not on the diagonal")

Another example: 

class Person:

	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name

	def say_hi(self):
		print('Hello, my name is', self.name)


p = Person('Nikhil')
p.say_hi()
Hello, my name is Nikhil

'string' < 'other string' to compare alphabetical order letter by letter. can also compare lists and tuples

module: import name.py  # now you can call any functions in the imported file using name.functionName. really you can call anything if you precede it with the module's name.

module.__name__ returns module name

from module_name import thing1, thing2 # will actually bring thing1 and thing2 into current module. i.e. you can call them
without preceding them with module name

from modname import *  # imports everything except names beginning with __ in modname, directly and without defining modname itself.

from modname import thing as newthing # changes thing to newthing as it imports it

the imports are only computed once. If you want to mess with the import and not have to restart to load the changes,
use importlib.reload()

dir(modname) shows everything defined in that module. dir() shows everything currently defined.
*it doesn't actually list all built-in functions


when opening a file, use 

with open("myfile.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line, end="")

to correctly close the file afterward
