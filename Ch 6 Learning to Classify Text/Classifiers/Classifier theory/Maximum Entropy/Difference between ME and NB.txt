Differences from Naive Bayes
----------------------------

Naive Bayes defines a parameter for each label (prior probability) and a parameter for each (feature, label) pair.
In contrast, Maximum Entropy allows the user to decide which combinations of labels and features should have their
own parameters. For example you can associate a feature with more than one label, or associate multiple features
with a label. This will sometimes allow the model to "generalize" over some of the differences between related labels
or features.

Each combination of labels and features is given its own parameter, which is called a JOINT-FEATURE. note joint
features are properties of labeled values. Simple features are properties of unlabeled values

In literature that describes and discusses Maximum Entropy models, the term "features" often refers to joint-
features; the term "contexts" refers to what we have been calling (simple) features.

In the end, like Naive Bayes, you're multiplying all your terms together. Except here all the terms are joint 
features involving the input and label.

		P(input, label) =  Prod joint-features(input,label) w[joint-feature]

***Naive Bayes is a GENERATIVE classifier. It predicts P(input, label). Meaning we're looking at the probability of
the input occurring along with the label.

Maximum Entropy is CONDITIONAL. It predicts P(label| input). Meaning we start by assuming the input, then look for 
most likely label. We can't use it to answer questions about probability of inputs.

eg:
---

1. What is the most likely label for a given input?
2. How likely is a given label for a given input?
3. What is the most likely input value?
4. How likely is a given input value?
5. How likely is a given input value with a given label?
6. What is the most likely label for an input that might have one of two values (but we don't know which)?

Naive Bayes can answer all of these. Maximum Entropy can only answer 1 and 2.
