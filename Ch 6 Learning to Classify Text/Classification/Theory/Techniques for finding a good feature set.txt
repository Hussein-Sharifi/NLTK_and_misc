Kitchen-sink approach
---------------------

*extract a bunch of features and check which are best at prediction using various accuracy checks, trial and error, 
and nltk.classify.show_most_informative_features(n)


Error analysis using development set approach
---------------------------------------------

*Instead of splitting dataset intro train and test, we split into development set and test. Development set is split
into train and devtest. Now we can train the model using the train set, test it on the devtest and make a list of
errors. We can then analyze these errors, try to spot patterns, then improve our feature function. Rinse and 
repeat, BUT: 

***choose a different development set each time, and MAKE SURE test stays separate the whole time.
