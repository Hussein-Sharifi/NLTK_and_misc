Recognizing textual entailment (RTE) is the task of determining whether a given piece of text T entails another text called the "hypothesis"

eg: (True)

T: Parviz Davudi was representing Iran at a meeting of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO), the fledgling association that binds Russia, China and four former Soviet republics of central Asia together to fight terrorism.

H: China is a member of SCO.

It should be emphasized that the relationship between text and hypothesis is not intended to be logical entailment, but rather whether a human would conclude that the text provides reasonable evidence for taking the hypothesis to be true.



def rte_features(rtepair):
    extractor = nltk.RTEFeatureExtractor(rtepair)
    features = {}
    features['word_overlap'] = len(extractor.overlap('word'))
    features['word_hyp_extra'] = len(extractor.hyp_extra('word'))
    features['ne_overlap'] = len(extractor.overlap('ne'))
    features['ne_hyp_extra'] = len(extractor.hyp_extra('ne'))
    return features


word overlap is common words between T and H, hyp_extra is words that are in H but not in T, ne is name entity.
Some stopwords are also thrown out. Now that we have our features:

rtepair = nltk.corpus.rte.pairs(['rte3_dev.xml'])[33]
extractor = nltk.RTEFeatureExtractor(rtepair)
>>>print(extractor.text_words)
{'Russia', 'Organisation', 'Shanghai', 'Asia', 'four', 'at',
'operation', 'SCO', ...}
>>> print(extractor.hyp_words)
{'member', 'SCO', 'China'}
>>> print(extractor.overlap('word'))
set()
>>> print(extractor.overlap('ne'))
{'SCO', 'China'}
>>> print(extractor.hyp_extra('word'))
{'member'}

All these features indicate the statement is likely to be true. This is kinda how the following function works:

nltk.classify.rte_classify
