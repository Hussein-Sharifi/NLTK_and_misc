movie_review categorizes reviews as positive or negative. We can use this dataset to practice classification.
Our plan is to develop a dataset that (review, category) tuples. Process through all words in the corpus using
FreqDist and keep the 2000 most common ones. Then, create a feature dict of the form {'contains(word)': True/False} We'll train naivebayes to predict positive/negative sentiment based on contained words



from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews

documents = [ (list(movie_reviews.words(fileid)), category)
             for category in movie_reviews.categories()
             for fileid in movie_reviews.fileids(category)]
random.shuffle(documents)

all_words = nltk.FreqDist(w.lower() for w in movie_reviews.words())
word_features = list(all_words)[:2000]

def document_features(document):
    features = {}
    document_words = set(w.lower() for w in document)
    for word in word_features:
         features[f'contains({word})'] = word in document_words
    return features

feature_set = nltk.classify.apply_features(document_features, documents)
>>> len(feature_set)
2000
train_set, test_set = feature_set[:1700], feature_set[1700:]

classifier = nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set)
>>> nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test_set)
0.76

>>> classifier.show_most_informative_features(5)
