Thinking of utterances as action types is a useful first step to processing dialogue. We're looking at the NPS
Chat Corpus and identifying with 15 action types, such as statement, emotion, ynQuestion, and continuer. The
corpus is labeled according to these classes, which we can access using post.get('class'), and we can access
the text using post.text(). First, we need to extract the data:

posts = nltk.corpus.nps_chat.xml_posts()[:10000]

def dialogue_features(post):
    features = {}
    for w in nltk.word_tokenize(post):
        features[f'contains ({w.lower()})'] = True
    return features

featuresets = [ ( dialogue_features(post.text), post.get('class') )
                for post in posts]
ninety = int( len(featuresets) * .9 )
train_set, test_set = featuresets[:ninety], featuresets[ninety:]

classifier = nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set)
nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test_set)
