WordNet: like a thesaurus

from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn

synset: synonym set. each word is associated with a synonym set of a particular meaning.

lemma: To eliminate ambiguity, we will identify these words as car.n.01.automobile, car.n.01.motorcar, and so on. This pairing of a synset with a word is called a lemma

These two relations navigate up and down the "is-a" hierarchy:
hyponym: words that are immediate "children" connected to the concept of a given word (ex. S.U.V. is a hyponym of car)
hypernyms: opposite of hyponym. the thing above it in abstraction

meronyms, holonyms and entailments:
from items to their components (meronyms) or to the things they are contained in (holonyms). For example, the parts of a tree are its trunk, crown, and so on; the part_meronyms(). The substance a tree is made of includes heartwood and sapwood; the substance_meronyms(). A collection of trees forms a forest; the member_holonyms()
the act of walking involves the act of stepping, so walking entails stepping

root hypernym: the most abstract hypernym



>>> wn.synsets('motorcar')
[Synset('car.n.01')]
*this tells us the only possible meaning of motorcar is car

to access synset with all synonyms:
>>> wn.synset('car.n.01').lemma_names()
['car', 'auto', 'automobile', 'machine', 'motorcar']

>>> wn.synset('car.n.01').definition()
'a motor vehicle with four wheels; usually propelled by an internal combustion engine'
>>> wn.synset('car.n.01').examples()
['he needs a car to get to work']


>>> wn.synset('car.n.01').lemmas()
[Lemma('car.n.01.car'), Lemma('car.n.01.auto'), Lemma('car.n.01.automobile'),
Lemma('car.n.01.machine'), Lemma('car.n.01.motorcar')]
>>> wn.lemma('car.n.01.automobile')
Lemma('car.n.01.automobile')
>>> wn.lemma('car.n.01.automobile').synset()
Synset('car.n.01')
>>> wn.lemma('car.n.01.automobile').name()
'automobile'

when using synsets: if a word has multiple possible meanings, we get multiple synsets:
>>> wn.synsets('car')
[Synset('car.n.01'), Synset('car.n.02'), Synset('car.n.03'), Synset('car.n.04'),
Synset('cable_car.n.01')]
>>> for synset in wn.synsets('car'):
...     print(synset.lemma_names())
...
['car', 'auto', 'automobile', 'machine', 'motorcar']
['car', 'railcar', 'railway_car', 'railroad_car']
['car', 'gondola']
['car', 'elevator_car']
['cable_car', 'car']

To get all the lemmas:
>>> wn.lemmas('car')
[Lemma('car.n.01.car'), Lemma('car.n.02.car'), Lemma('car.n.03.car'),
Lemma('car.n.04.car'), Lemma('cable_car.n.01.car')]


in this example, we extract all hyponyms, each hyponym is a synset type. then we find all the lemmas associated
with that synset, and sort their names:
>>> motorcar = wn.synset('car.n.01')
>>> types_of_motorcar = motorcar.hyponyms()
>>> sorted(lemma.name() for synset in types_of_motorcar for lemma in synset.lemmas())



In this example, we only extract nouns:
>>> for synset in wn.synsets('mint', wn.NOUN):
...     print(synset.name() + ':', synset.definition())
...
