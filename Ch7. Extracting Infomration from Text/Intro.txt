Goal is to extract information from text. Two strategies: 

1. Construct a general representation of meaning and let the machine glean the required information from the text. 
2. Convert the text from unstructured to structured data. Called INFOMRATION EXTRACTION. This is the topic of this
chapter.

Architecture:

Sentence segmentation then tokenize words
POS tagging ---> NE recognition
Relation Detection to find relations between entities. 

>>> def ie_preprocess(document):
...    sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(document) [1]
...    sentences = [nltk.word_tokenize(sent) for sent in sentences] [2]
...    sentences = [nltk.pos_tag(sent) for sent in sentences] [3]
