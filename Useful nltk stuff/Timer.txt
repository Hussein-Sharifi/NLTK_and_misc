from timeit import Timer

Timer(stmt given as string, setup stmt given as string)
methods:
.timeit(# of runs)


*two notes: 
1: Timer runs stmt and setup stmt in separate environments and so it needs packages imported for each statement.
2: You can run two commands in one line by using ;. Example: print(5); print(1) will return as if each was entered on its
own line


eg:
from timeit import Timer

vocab_size = 100000
setup_list = 'import random; vocab = list(range({}))'.format(vocab_size)
setup_set = 'import random; vocab = set(range({}))'.format(vocab_size)
statement = 'random.randint(0, {})'.format(vocab_size*2)

print(Timer(statement, setup_list).timeit(1000))
print(Timer(statement, setup_set).timeit(1000))
