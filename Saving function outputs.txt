The process of saving contents to a file is known as serialization. Loading that content back up is called 
deserialization.



Serialization 
-------------

from pickle import dump

output_data = f(arguments)
with open('FileName.pk1', 'wb') as output_file:
    dump(output_data, output_file, -1)


*recall 'with' lets Python know to close the file after the operation is done. If you're not using 'with', you can
manually close using output_file.close
*-1 tells dump to use the latest serialization protocol available (since [-1] is last item in a list)
*wb tells Python to open the file in binary, which is needed to save the output using dump.
*If you want to save the file to a different directory, just replace output_data with absolute or relative file path.



Deserialization
---------------

from pickle import load

with open('FileName.pk1', 'rb') as input_file:
    loaded_data = load(input_file)
