import csv

*data tabulations for lexical entries. Should look like:

sleep, sli:p, v.i, a condition of body and mind ...
walk, wo:k, v.intr, progress by lifting and setting down each foot ...
wake, weik, intrans, cease to sleep

eg:

>>> import csv
>>> input_file = open("lexicon.csv", "rb") [1]
>>> for row in csv.reader(input_file): [2]
...     print(row)
['sleep', 'sli:p', 'v.i', 'a condition of body and mind ...']
['walk', 'wo:k', 'v.intr', 'progress by lifting and setting down each foot ...']
['wake', 'weik', 'intrans', 'cease to sleep']
