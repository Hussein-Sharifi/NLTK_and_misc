yield
-------
Method 1: using initialized empty list. You're familiar with this method.
Method 2: uses yield to create a generator object. More efficient

Eg:
def search1(substring, words):
    result = []
    for word in words:
        if substring in word:
            result.append(word)
    return result

def search2(substring, words):
    for word in words:
        if substring in word:
            yield word
