One popular method for processing data efficiently is Divide and Conquer: split data of size n into two n/2 datasets, and repeat. Process each dataset and merge it all back together. 

One example of this is searching a dictionary by opening in the middle. If the word we care about is in the first half, we split that one in half and so on.

Recursion works nicely with approach. We can often call a function recursively to process a split version of the original dataset. Check Ch4/functions/Recursion Using Yield
