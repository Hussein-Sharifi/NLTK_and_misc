def permutation(seq):
	if len(seq) <= 1:
		yield seq
	else:
		for perm in permutation(seq[1:]):
			for i in range(len(perm)+1):
				yield perm[:i] + seq[0:1] + perm[i:]

How it works:

Suppose seq = 'abc'. Run permutation(seq) and we enter the else clause. 

Step 1: for perm in permutation(seq[1:]) runs the function from beginning with permutation('bc'). 

Step 2: In this run, seq = 'bc'. Again, we enter the else clause and the function runs again with permutation('c').

Step 3: Now, seq = 'c', which activates the if clause yielding 'c'. This is the value of permutation('c'), which is 
now passed back to the second run.

Step 4: Back to second run. Recall seq = 'bc' here. We can now compute the following: for perm in permutation('c'). 
The for loop inserts c before and after b. Thus, permutation('bc') = ['bc', 'cb']

Step 5: We're back to the first run, where seq = 'abc'. We can compute for perm in permutation(['bc', 'cb']) 

Step 6: etc.
