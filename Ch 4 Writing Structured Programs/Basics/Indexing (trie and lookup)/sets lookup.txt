say you have a vocabulary and want to check if each word in a text already is in the vocabulary. And, if not, add it.

In this case it's muuuch faster to use a set because sets are automatically indexed.


eg:
def preprocess(tagged_corpus):
    words = set()
    tags = set()
    for sent in tagged_corpus:
        for word, tag in sent:
            words.add(word)
            tags.add(tag)
    wm = dict((w, i) for (i, w) in enumerate(words))
    tm = dict((t, i) for (i, t) in enumerate(tags))
    return [[(wm[w], tm[t]) for (w, t) in sent] for sent in tagged_corpus]
